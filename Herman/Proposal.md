# Project List

1. **OS and file system**
	* create a small program that accepts user input free typing and save it as new file.
	* create a program that compares two files given by user input, show how many differences between these two files and which line is different. it's pretty similar to diff function on Linux
	* Write a program, when the user enters the file name and line number (N), print the first N lines of the file to the screen
	* To expand on the basis of the previous item, the user can input the number of lines to be displayed at will. (For example, enter 13:21 to print lines 13 to 21, enter: 21 to print the first 21 lines, and enter 21: to print everything from line 21 to the end of the file)
	* Write a program to implement the "find and replace all" function.
	* Bulk rename files on given directory, apply multiple rules such like prefix, suffix, file name word replacement.

		
2. **RESTful API**
	* _Compose a python script to access web public API without OAuth or api key required and simple json data structure._
	* _furthermore with previous one, now access and request data from larger web API site with authentication requirement and parameters in endpoint url._
	* _load and dump json data from return request then load to RDBMS_
	* _manipulate data by leveraging pandas, numpy and ORM, DBAPI_
	* _visualized results by matplotlib, pyplot or pyechart_
